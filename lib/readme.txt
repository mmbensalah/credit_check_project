#Questions

1. What are you proud of?

After I had the initial program with many variables, I decided to try and redo
the whole program using instance variables. I ran into a lot of trouble and I
am still unclear on many issues (which I will enumerate below), but I am proud
that I took the opportunity to try and do something harder at a point when I knew
I did not have to worry about a final evaluation. I am also proud of the amount
of time that I spent working and trying to understand the project. Perhaps I
could be more efficient in the future, but I don't think I could have spent more
time than I did working on this.

2. What do you need to improve?

With the project itself, a lot of things need improvement. In the end, I could not
figure out how to use pry to even check the program itself to see where the issues
were. I also need to improve my understanding of classes, their components and
how/why they are used. I also did not have time to make a test considering my
understanding of the methods and class themselves were so shaky.


3. What questions do you still have?

  a. How to use pry to debug
  b. How to use classes
  c. Wrapping methods in methods

# Rubric

## Functionality

  Notes:

  - [2] Student completes through Iteration 3

  ## Mechanics

  Notes:

  The student(s):

  - [3] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
  - [3] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
  - [3] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
  - [3] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
  - [2] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

  ## Design

  Notes:

  The student(s):

  - [3] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
  - [2] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
  - [2] uses instance and local variables appropriately
  - [3] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
      * Variable and method names are self explanatory
      * Methods are under 7 lines
      * Lines of code are under 80 characters
      * Project directory structure adheres to convention
      * A linter reports less than 5 errors

  ## Testing

  Notes:

  The student(s):

  - [1] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
  - [1] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
  - [1] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
  - [1] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
  - [1] writes both integration and unit tests

  ## Version Control

  Notes:

  The student(s):

  - [1] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
  - [1] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
  - [1] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
